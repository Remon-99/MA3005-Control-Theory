<h1>MA3005 Control Theory Project: Self-Balancing Robot with Matlab and Simulink</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the MA3005 Control Theory project, I collaborated with my group mates to design a self-balancing robot using Matlab
and Simulink. The robot, featuring a top-heavy structure with two wheels, showcased advanced control mechanisms
where we implemented algorithms enabling the robot to autonomously balance, move to specified locations, maintain
preset angles, and control its speed. This project not only demonstrated the practical application of control theory
concepts but also underscored our proficiency in utilizing Matlab and Simulink for real-world robotic systems.
